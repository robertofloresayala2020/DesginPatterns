# 📌 Design Patterns Repository

This repository contains implementations of multiple **design patterns** in different programming languages. It is intended as a reference for developers who want to learn, practice, or apply design patterns in their projects.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each design pattern will be organized in its own folder, following this structure:

```
/design-patterns
    /creational
        /singleton
        /factory-method
    /structural
        /adapter
        /decorator
    /behavioral
        /observer
        /strategy
```

Each folder will contain:
- 📜 **Source code** with practical examples.
- 📖 **Pattern explanation** and use cases.
- ✅ **Unit test examples** (if applicable).
